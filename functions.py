if __name__ == "__main__":
    extract_archive("005 compressed.zip", "files")
This is a very common Python pattern, and it‚Äôs used to control what code gets executed when a Python file is run directly versus
 when it is imported as a module.

üîç Explanation
üîπ __name__
__name__ is a special built-in variable in Python.

When you run a script directly, like:


python myscript.py
then Python sets __name__ to the string "__main__" inside that file.

But if you import that same file as a module:


import myscript
then __name__ will be "myscript" (i.e. the filename, not "__main__").

üîπ if __name__ == "__main__":
This checks:

‚ùì ‚ÄúAm I running this file directly, or is it being imported?‚Äù

If you are running the file directly (like a script), it executes the indented code under it.
If the file is just being imported, it skips that part.

‚úÖ Why It‚Äôs Useful
It lets your file do both:

Act like a script (for testing or running functionality)

Be imported as a module (to reuse the function extract_archive() somewhere else)

üîÅ In Your Case
You're saying:


if __name__ == "__main__":
    extract_archive("005 compressed.zip", "files")
üü∞ "Only extract this zip file if I run this file directly."

But if someone else writes:


from my_zip_module import extract_archive
They can now call extract_archive(...) without triggering the extraction immediately.

| Case                 | What Happens                                                           |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `python myscript.py` | ‚úÖ Runs the `extract_archive(...)` call                                 |
| `import myscript`    | ‚ùå Skips the `extract_archive(...)` call (but function still available) |
